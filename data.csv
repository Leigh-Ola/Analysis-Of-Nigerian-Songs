To take money from the church, invest in business
And privatize it No!

You go and setup a university that the members cannot attend
Cannot send their children to

So me call up Lily to harmonize this

Here’s To The Government
Suckled On Some Slave D–K

Real quick, like the joker going right off the back
Wanna see me out there’s a rider for that
Me and you up in a battle you couldn’t sign up for that
They gon need a scrapper just to get your back off the mark
‘Cos you, get crumbled, I move full throttle
A trouble that’s coming for you if you try to slow my hustle
Down, brown, paper, bags
A flow like this I swear your fav never had
I know I dey mad chics digging me they giving me
A big fat blunt like Santa’s stuck up in the chimney
Bow legged rapper when I ball you see the skill in me
See mans not hot but you can tell it’s zero chill in me
Want a crib that look like a sorority

‘Cos I be getting women and I’ll do it with authority
Shout out to all women now they more on me want more of me
But honestly nowadays a lot of ya’ll be boring me
Right now the hip-hop game’s been ignoring me
Act like they don’t see what the boy be doing globally
Things I’m doing on a large scale would leave you (?)
I’m like a sound sultan my flows got a black belt
So what the plan my bro?
‘Cos am hear to give em really what they asking for
Anyone’s that got some issues that I should know
Speak now so I can split your a-s in four

That’s a, sign of a cross and a, sign of your loss
You should, read the reports TINNY round of applause
And a, word to the boss you said it was time to boss
Then my brother hooked me up and I definitely must
Pause, real talk you know I tell the truth

[Verse 2]
Back to the rap for the real fan addicts
I been all the way up like a big man’s headache
You try to pull me down but the n—a can’t die
Best African in hip-hop and am guessing here’s why
My flow is so impeccable despicable
You avoid the colab ‘Cos you know that am a threat to you
The rest of ya’ll feeling cool it’s only ‘Cos am letting you
And know you can keep shut and do what you suppose to do
Bruh, I wish, that one will try to step to a brother like this
You wanna see war I bring it to your eyelids, iris, I live
For the fool that say, that I ain’t sick is

I’m they type to call my side, my cousin
I’m the type to call my cousin to cuddle
I’m the type to never ball on no budget
F0ck that, keep my eye on the money
I’m the type to teach my diamonds to dougie
Water on me like I shower in public

Drip, drip, drip
I be shining like I’m forced to
Like it wasn’t a choice
I never run out of sauce
Can you not see that I am gorgeous
My nigher I used to be her zaddy, now she a orphan
If she could seduce you for a bag, be woke
Nasty you did, you ran up a bag kudos
You could be the greatest or you could be the greatest
Who knows?
Stomp the yard with the stones

[Chorus]
You would swear Mandela was my dance teacher
The way I got money moves
But I ain’t gotta dance no more
Coz my jewelry got hella moves
I used to broke but now I got notes
Man I make hella tunes
Look how I make em dance like my jewelry
Check how I make em dance like my jewelry
Check how I make em dance

{Verse 2 – Tellaman}
My jewelry dance and it sparkle like soda
She gives dope neck, I might just buy her a choker
Yeah she sits on it, like we ain’t got a sofa
Cuban on my neck ain’t local, at least my swag ain’t local
I’m her daddy, but she call me zaddy
She wanna have my baby but I made her have a plan b
My jewelry wet like it flows, and it shine and it glows
And we flexing on em foes
They like he bad and he knows
My swag drips it makes her wet
They saw them links, now they talking bout let’s connect
I bring the heat and your girls wants me to hit it
She wanna be my bae, I told her btch beat it
I make her dance, make her dance like a diamond
Ain’t worried bout no alcohol, I got a rider
What would they do without us, I really wonder
I got the juice and the sauce right

[Chorus]
You would swear Mandela was my dance teacher
The way I got money moves
But I ain’t gotta dance no more
Coz my jewelry got hella moves

Left the club because we’re drunk already
Left your car but you’ll come back and get it
If she did it then she don’t regret it
Five gold chains, and now they think I’m sellin’

[Verse 1: Young Thug]
I just ran it up for my people’s sake
I just fucked that bitch on a birthday cake
Fuck me fifty times, this some
Told her I ain’t play no games, ain’t no Playstation
My dreads gettin’ long and my niggas Haitian
I gave that bitch a bone just to penetrate
Baby I ain’t never home, man I’m overseas
No US dollars, I got chrome faces
Pop a bean, get you eat out
Chains on my neck stand and they stay out
Every time she wanna fuck she come say, “may I?”
And call me mister if you want this payout
I stay at home in the bed all day
Bitch gave me head, I could play all day
Pussy comin’ in, I get
I think bitches comin’ in, I get slayed all day

[Chorus: Davido]
If I give you one pere (pere)
You’ll be coming back to me, you’ll be begging for more
And if I give you one pere (pere)

All I do is strike out, I don’t never spare
Petty ass hoes, all these bitches welcome
All these bitches ready
If she in my bedroom then the bitch naked
Gotta get that back end
Big money on my mind, every minute, every second
Elevator to the top, where you headed?
I fuck her ’til I’m sweating
She been throwing that pussy ever since she met me
Said she lookin’ for love, I say forget it
Nut on her back and that’s where I left it
Snoop in with the camera when she undressing
She gon’ do it for me like Simon said it

[Verse 3: Swae Lee]

121,LYRICS: Modenine – Otis Again + Primetime ft M- Trill & D- Truce,"you say you tHe dopes out huh scratch dat/

back packers get slapped jacked for their nap sacks /

new school rappers get their spine broke -snap back /

for rocking fake snap backs that’s mad wack/

purple. Slacks yellow kicks what kinda swag is dat/

oops I said it , ok swag /

sue me shoot me report me to the principal /

when I connect pen to paper I’m invincible /

im off the rocker my sense of humor is whimsical /

magical without the talisman or tentacle /

brave hearts get. Smacked up with poison. Tentacles /

left and a right force on impact identical /

your blood pump malfunctions in both ventricles /

spot on , mood got flow though/

big man ting straight jeans , I’m rocking polo /

track down going for solo/

kicks too clean I stomp you bare foot – frodo /

you catch feelings I’m throwing solos /

punchlines I don’t lend neither do I borrow /

too busy leading I’m Moses I don’t follow/

buff space at the top I’m swinging both elbows /

the view is good though you will never notice /

oops I did it again I just murdered otis /

I aunt done yet call this the overkill /

cold flow over chill /

don’t sign me then Nova will/

duck over your head my word plays over the hill/

landing in the cleavage of a lass that they call jill/

jack won’t do jack or jack ‘ll get jacked for real/

I’m digressing back to the topic nobody testing  /

uh my naysayers they all confessing /

you better count your blessings I’m in a good mood /

or I can put a lid on your food like late dinner /

leave you like a volatile solvent – thinner /

rig the score board you still won’t be a winner/

heard you freestyle you better be a great swimmer /

mango heads talking noise /

a bunch queer peso’s ( pedigrees ) shy they ducking boys /

that’s a joke but if your mad you can take shots /

matter of fact if you mad then you take cocks /

yous a worker all I see you do is scrape pots /

over boss your girl under us /

watch the throne while I’m still in it /

you a body guard stay still init (uk slang for isn’t it) /

dragon breath rappers got me putting a peg on my nose /

I roll with a pack no regular joe’s /

stone fish flip flops don’t step on my toes /

no compress you’re thinking too slow.

 

Primetime Featuring M-Trill And D-Truce 

D-Truce

Like mathematics they hating on me just cause they don’t  understand,
Categorically you can place me down at the deeper end,
I’m Always standing out don’t see the fucking need to blend,
There’s snitches all about so I’m careful with who I pick as friends,
I’m not your average rapper and yes I keep it real,
You need entertainment fuck it I’m spitting how I feel,
These niggers can’t see my dreams with a second look,
I guess their vision’s impaired that’s why they’re taking second looks,
Me and a microphone homie that’s the perfect pair,
The game got me broke but its nothing that I can’t repair,
I hustle right G still you don’t like me?
You’all thinking on the road I’m thinking where that flight be,
And when that flight leaves I’ll be on it,
Flying to the top while you niggers steady running,
You get what I’m tryna say?,
We all heading to the top but you’all walking I flew I took the faster way,
Like jewelry thieves they tryna take my shine away,
But ama kill ‘em all before I put the mic away.
Easy….that’s all I’ve got to say.

M-Trill

I gat my eyes on d continent/

i’m confident/

dat wen I spit/

everybody b like modo who d heck is dis/

d mic apocalypse/

so here’s d countdown/

d cashdown/

2 hit d high notes like a vocalist/

i’m much too dope 4 dis/

so blow ur candles out,dey wishing I’ma fade,neva happen like a bday wish/

its inevitable like mr anderson/

d Neo in d matrix bullshit,pure fantasy/

u tink its speech/

till d metal touch ur cheek/

automatic set on rapid,how we do it in d creeks/

so eff ur battles,I’m on trial 4 a war-crime/

genocide,metaphors r neva sublime/

i hear dey sayin u d shit but really mean u crap/

rhymes r dressed up,bars r lookin really sharp/

in it like a clip/

a phcity chief/

d rhymes will always end up on d militancy tip/

Modenine

I’m anywhere the wind blows /

never wearing pink clothes /

Trayvon hoodie on butter color timbos /

through the louvers , I cat whistle at passing bimbos /

contradiction and ill be macking from a window ( Mac – windows Xp)

higher life form , speaking martian lingo/

bitches , playing numbers on my balls bingo/

cyborg mind state super star ringo /

if its beef you can have a slice of this kimbo ( kimbo slice)

uh a one way ticket to planet limbo /

alien cyclic DNA don’t contest /

the grand master universal vulcan chess /

technician – Nigerian Lord Finesse /

I cause a mess when I’m hyper I’m pounding heads /

kicking ass till my white sneaks are brown and red /

mad man you’re lucky my doctors found my Meds /

chill pill taken now I’m swimming in a pile of bread.

Me am like ma ceo call me super

Wanna know ma last name? Try!- duper

Kinda like Collins and Megan I feel (Phil) good (Good)

Haters r like bishop necks bt me am real Hood

I cover my mind spitting u d hoody rap

I’ve got hard punches, I don’t seeurjuvy jabs

I’m a wealth of words can u reach (rich) me

Island of knowledge surrounded by the flow can’t bridge me

H.O.T. ma man u can’t fridge me

I steal shines with con tracks (contracts) can’t breach me

May weather mover – fighter drama

Y’all using words wrong u need brighter grammar

And Vec is a beast any beat is a meal

Dem dey say I dey FORM isn’t that what u feel (fill)

InCotonouI’m high like codeine

So I make Benin (bene) lean (lyn) towards me

 

CHORUS:

4give me am wasted

Am happy am wasted

Am feeling elevated am rapping but am wasted

Go in X2

Am slow- codeine

Go in X2

Am slow – blame codeine

 

Vers2:

I good die

It’s like I die for a living

Deep in d flow like I dive for a living

Am in d air playing (plane) am in flight for a living

Buturlike the super eagles

Urflight is deceiving

All hours time is all our

Can’t surprise us nothing awe ours

Am on it

Height’s quite chronic

Top or TAILS we run around like SONIC

Ran for run 12 bring blood like d tonic

Its d actions on ma pages no comics

When I get on it is impossible to boo

When I bust on stage like Janet Jackson’s boob

Nobody like me like all hate me like Chris cos I rock? Hiss!

The game is shit, waste in a rest room

Want my two cents (scents)? Geturown perfume

 

CHORUS:

Am happy am wasted

Verse 3

Am a beast

Like I roll with wolverine

Description should be huge, strong, blue skin

Am taking it over from the rappers all around me

Clifford orji mode- skulls all around me

YSG see d team in d sky

Any other team in d sky is a lie

The closest they’d get to high is rocking high tops even my lawyer too fly he’s killing the high court

And we get d ladies they luv to hug “V”

I don’t run with balls I don’t play rugby

If rap I’d wealth then most of y’all r worthless

I been around more ice than superman’s fortress- cold blooded

Dotn fuck with these guys but in disguise they claim platonic

Spare me the lies cos I’ve seen honest

We’re real super heroes yall are green hornets you’re funny!

Am happy am wasted

Am feeling elevated am rapping bt am wasted

Ever since I left you
I have been to hell and I am back
And my baby, I
I wanna give you all my body and soul
And I want to give you the keys to all that I got
Girl you are my star, you are my rainbow

Cos now I don’t see rainbows, everywhere I go
It never used to be so (be so)
Oh now my heart is cold
Now it’s a big cloud (big cloud)
Hovering over my soul
And i won’t shout (won’t shout)
Don’t wanna be on mute no more (be on mute no more)

Ever since I left you girl
It’s like I fell off
Now I can’t get back online Since I logged off
I am feeling all alone
I don’t feel free no more
I am a prisoner for you like I am in handcuffs

Now I wonder what I was thinking when I took off
Now i realize that your lips and body so soft
Girl i am not too proud to beg
I will kneel and kiss your legs
Cos I am fed up

Ever since I left you
I have been to hell and I am back
And my baby, I
I wanna give you all my body and soul
Infact I want to give you the keys to all that I got
Girl you are my star, you are my rainbow

Life without you
Is just a rip-off
All them other girls, them a bloody knockoff
I was a jerk and i feel with remorse
Girl i need some cleansing baby
Help me detox

I want you back
Girl, just don’t say no
Cos if you  do
Murder will be the case they gave your heart
Cos there’s no life without you
And I cannot swim up to the shore

I want back into your life
I am giving you heads up
And you know say people break up and make up
Girl you got to understand
That with you I want to stand forever and ever and ever
You must to know that life is a set up
And as a natural man, that’s why I effed up
Girl, see I don’t know what else to say
Just accept my humble apology

Cos
Ever since I left you
I have been to hell and I am back
And my baby, I
I wanna give you all my body and soul
Infact I want to give you the keys to all that I got
Girl you are my star, you are my rainbow
(You are my star girl)

eh Chineke me
Girl, I am down on my knees
Accept my apologies
E no easy
Now i realize, it should be you and I
You and I ..Iiiiiiiiii

Ever since I left you girl
Ever since I left you (left you girl)
Ever since I left you girl
The keys, keys, take it take it take it take it take it girl

Ever since I left you (you are my rainbow)
I have been to hell and I am back
you are my rainbow
you are my rainbow
you are my rainbow
Infact I want to give you the keys to all that I got
you are my rainbow (my rainbow)
you are my rainbow

Ever since I left you
I have been to hell and I am back
And my baby, I
I wanna give you all my body and soul
Infact I want to give you the keys to all that I got
Girl you are my star, you are my rainbow

Verse 1 – Skales
Dj Mewsic turn the music up
I’ve seen this before they want me to flop
I enjoy seeing my haters broken hearted I’ve been winning all ever since the day I started
That’s why I’m wanting this forever you can have a day
Took it to another level make them learn the hard way
Everybody is an actor in my dream am living it to the fullest you can tell from every scene
I cheated on life feeling like a crook
All I do is win am living like a tpain hook
Never get broke or get out of rich
Life is not fair success is what I use to bleach
Unlike you am the next thing after fresh
You witnessing a God disguised in flesh
You messing with the best
No contest that’s why Banky put me on so I can manifest

Chorus
I love the life of the life that am living
I don’t give an eff what they saying
Omo ti je lo na o je lo na o

Cream of the crop that’s the cocoa butter

I’ll be in that honor roll
I’m a terrorist behind bars “Guantanamo”
when it come to all these hoes

lease some game into they brain
and let em know it’s time to roll
she saying she ain’t gone suck it
but fuck it she gone ride it though
but before I’m done
Imma slap my dick up down her throat
get my thing, mistake my claim
and now I keep that pot of gold
If I burn my bridges I swear Imma go and find a boat
real niggas shit you feel me
tryna be responsible
they hate it that I made it
but they love the way I’m shinning tho
been about my business since a kid
even my mama know

Hommie is a lie if you say we ain’t bossing

And never will I anytime soon

[Saucekid]

The truth is spoken, the coupe is dope and I’m feeling cool
and smoking, the roof is open

These other rappers is losing focus
A few provoked from the dudes joking
my bad, you could notice
I raise the bar of rapping, I’m just being honest
I’m the best in the game I swear I’m being modest
I’m high as a mur’fucker that’s my level B
your phone ain’t got blue-tooth but she got yellow teeth
Ha, Lowkey, I love the way this travel be

6 foot, 7 foot, 8 foot Bunch

 

MI:

Yaw

Pardon my bravado

I only want the title

I’m killing everything I’m on, I guess I’m suicidal

The rest ain’t say you’re nothing men, They incommunicado

While I rock from Lag to Mars, call it a murcielago

Got different goals so we ball different

I’m tryna find some competition, like it’s gone missing

See haters raising disciples just to come and get him, Luke,

Mark my words I’m not  John (also a slang for toilet) u piss on

Criminal story-teller, call me John Grisham

Illegal Music, Nigger gotta speak with conviction

Hehe

Now tell me that ain’t the line of the year

Haters see me and get wood,because they’re dying to cheer

I swear the game is ’bout to vanish men, if I ain’t appear

It’s like ma money grow on trees and I ain’t tryna share

Most of dis niggas and SUCCESS av a dying affair,

And when I’m talking ’bout PJs men, I’m flying Alair

Hehe

Well, I mean not me personally ‘cos I can’t, I got a pilot n’ shit

Hehe

Yaw

 

Flier than Emirates

M is rated than meritance

Lyrical miracles as I spit pivotal parables

Microphone and B.P apparatus

Turn a beat into particles

I ain’t the greatest yet but then I’m very close

Close like a best friend

Yes M is sexing

Any beats, send ‘em, I’ll right ‘em like any question

They didn’t use to send M but now, it’s like they texting and pressing

The rest got him bored, like a guest dinner

Tickle the Clit, I put my Eastwood in her Westend

And North side headed for my Southpole

Mouth all over till her mouth swollen

I’m just chilling making millions, getting different numbers calling me, like a dice roll

When I’m in the club, I handle bars like a bicycle

Niggers tryna simulate my flyness, They in flight school

These niggers of mine, so wanna fail, I’m a maestro

Illegal Music 2, I did it twice, I did nice bro

See the difference clear, 7Up

Niggers puffin’, think they’re big and I hit ‘em up

And then I hang ‘em up, prank call

You have plans to make cheques rain… cancel

See my pants full, ‘cos I ball big

Always hitting the spot like an oil rig

Y’all niggers need more, Ammunition B4

 

You can’t think of blowing up, so what we got is C4

You got weak bars, only weighing a lil(lil wayne reference)

I’m at the centre o’ things, like to stay in the middle

I take these rappers apart like I’m playing Geppetto

I’m guilty of being dope and there is no acquittal

And on the real dough, M can really still flow

Like I took Adenuga’s company, ‘cos I still GLOw

Watch the way you bang into rings and call me Bilbo

Still nobody fucking with me, get a dildo

Nigger

Yeah

Hehe

Phenom, let’s go

 

PHENOM:

 

Unh

I know you’re broke but please Pay attention

I’m so old in this game, I should be paper paid in pension

I go harder than erection

I bring rappers depression

I’m spitting on bars like pregnant chicks during detention

And I ma make it rain, fuck the global recession

I’m not saying I’m the best, but who else brings perfection

I’m the right answer to hip hop aint no questioning

And, you are just a pain in the butt, like injection

Raa

 

Edo boy with a Las Gidi attitude

I stack doves in line and I ain’t even talking Barbecues

Babalawo flow, Things are ’bout to go spiritual

Hip-Hop was dead but here’s an atmosphere for miracle

Rappers looking edible, I’m a lyrical cannibal

It’s dinner time and I’m dining with the Incredible, Mister

We topping the lista

O Boy, if you dey hate, jump out the window, I ain’t talking Vista

Flow z immaculate,u knw dat I’m redundant, I’m jst warming up..yezzir!

Unh

Listen

Running Gidi O

Spitting Ili flow with ma Ili bro

Make the green(Da Grin) like CEO

In the dark, you gon’ see me glow

Rappers get Close like TV Show

For reali O, I’m illi bro

I’ll never Back Down ‘cos I am not a fan of Gidigbo

I’m on the throne baby, you just a Prom King

Like Michael Jackson, you’re fucking with the wrong kid

So better lean back, and watch your nigger stay fat

Phenomous phobia, I leave rappers with the stage fright

Skinny jeans tho but ma pockets stay fat

By June next year, I’ll be tryna get my May back

T-square rappers, They got me so board

I got a chick’s CV from a blow job

Heh

We signing out

Yaw

Unh

Think of your eyes on Monday
Think of your lips on Tuesday
Think of your smile on Wednesday
I think of your kiss on thursday
And Friday, Saturday, Sunday go
Imma stay hoping that someday soon
You’ll bring back the sunlight to my universe so
I can be over the moon
My world, why you wan leave
Cos everybody knows me I can’t breathe
Without you here me no complete
Till you go imma be empty in a gun suite
Gotta put up a facade
That I am ok when you’re not by my side
Tell what to do when my scalp feel blue
and my heart feel pain that cannot be massaged

Oh baby oh baby o
I wanted you to know
I’ll miss you when you go
Seven days
Seven days of the week

Baby imma miss you plenty
On Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday
When you’re gone, the day’s so long
I can’t write songs, my world’s so empty
Seven days of the week and the weekend
I miss you girl when I’m sleeping
If devotion and emotion are a notion
that i’m stuck in the deep end
If you must go, then you must go
But you live my world cold

So just know that wherever you go, baby US go
and I go, in my heart, i’m right there beside you
And i’ll miss you like a typo
WHen i’m trying to spell ah, Imma write go
Cos you have me close, it’s so vital
My baby

All day long
All night long
Seven days
Seven days
All day long
All night long
Seven days
Seven days of the week

Omoge o
I wanted you to know
I’ll miss you when you go
Seven days

Ladies and gentlemen

Olamide is the same with the everyday people
THE difference between me and niggas is simple
They’ve got talent so dey talent showcasing
Me I’m talent hustling
More money chasing[wa shere]
I let my talent go showcase itself
Niggas talking shit about me like ‘Who u be self?
BEFORE you find out make I tell you myself
So you no go shout when you see skeleton in my shelf

Me I’m a murderer
Now you’ve been told but
Ma so fun anybody that is the code

Abeg na wey the doctor you know wey fit treat me

Even if i be drum, Cabasa no fit beat me

Intro
Chocolate city picture presents: MI, Brymo, MI2 , Action film
Let’s go (oshe ocada)
Left left left left left left (oshe danfo)
Left right left right left right (gbe keke e)
Ladies and gentleman, I am back (oya oya oya kalo)

Chorus
I’ll like to take you for a ride
I’ll be your superman, I’ll take you to the sky
So fun won, kpe ko wa tasi mi
Cos I be actor for this action film

Verse 1
Yo, back with a banger
For the hood, for the streets, for the zanga
The return of the microphone handler
Came back to set a new standard
More bread, more butter, more batter
More fanta, no coke, no ganja
So gifted that he must know santa
No slander let them hail his reign more Banta
They might wonder, they might ponder
How a short black boy can conquer
From a legedes benz to a Honda
To a crib from the bridge he was under
Did he do yahoo, did he launder
Now chics follow bumper to bumper
See awards everywhere in the bunker
It’s the chocolate boss, willy wonker

(Hook)
Haaaayyyy, Mo ti gbere mi de eeeeee
Go tell your mommy, tell your daddy, tell your brother too
And if you want me, baby let me know it cos I do
With you

(Repeat chorus)

Verse 2
Yo back with my new flow
For the club, for the street, for the studios
In my new crib, new car, new clothes
Same actor, different year, new boss
I am a bad guy, who knows sharp guys, who know fly guys, who pop nuvos
And the champagne do flow any time we celebrate cos we generate new dough
And we off to conquer a new coast
Anywhere the game has got loopholes
All these rappers that be forming I-too-knows,
They can’t keep up, they need glucose
Where did M come from, mehn who knows
No other rap sounds like Judo’s
And he’s not alone, he’s got two bros
For the two or one or who knows
Choc city boys say…

(Repeat hook)
(Repeat chorus)

Bridge
O n se mi se mi
Bi ki n party party
Bobo toh soji soji
Oun ni baby reti
I am feeling fine
The mood is right
We on tonight
Let’s go there (12x)

Verse 3
Yo…So back with the ginja
With the son of the carpenter
For another brand new adventure
My flow so cold, I bring winter
I am the lyrical kung fu ninja
Enemies all around tryna injure
MI holding down in the center
Cos I’m championship like inter
These dudes can’t reach where I been to
Got the Mo’cheddah flow, can’t censor
And I stand all alone like oriental
But I am gentle , so simple, I’m a mentor
See everytime I flow, I am a painter
Hiphop’s in trouble, imma save her

First of all let’s get it clear
I’m not going anywhere
Because orisa Femi
I don’t mean arogunmenite
Speak the shit that many fear
I am a machine that never tears
And i don’t clearly Wear
All you boys know the man is here
Oh we teaching money now we
You too aren’t dumbing down
Because u make the game about the stupid greed you want it now
So take it
Take the chance
Trace it
Make the plans
Brace quick
Face the man
Make sure you say my name
Encounter your destiny child
Your gangstar is sesame styled
You streets is comedy
I recommend that with a trippy cloud

And see my girl is the s**t, she on that Loo-Boo-Tin (huh)
How Christian (Louboutin) is that?
Well i see pastors engaging forces with voodoo rings
Am like f**k how Christian is that
And so you see the way you reasoning isn’t the I reason
With you, you might sell an album
But with me i may go to prison
See you knew from the start when i was realing u were bitching
And that’s the only reason why you take money from politicians
See we know you’re politicking
When u acting tough
Your story no longer lifting
Why you acting buff
You don’t inspire
The relevance on any level that you desire
Would be stupid
If you knew
Art doesn’t really expire
Meaning you no longer see your self as art
Oh shit L.O.L see this man – he a fraud…

I no know when the prayer go stop

Don’t go and sell your vote
Don’t go and be a goat
Or God go punish you
Give you 5k today
Tomorrow, bag of rice na 50k
yea yea yea yea

Take this thing away men
What’s the hell with you?
Are…are…are you normal?
Are you normal?

[Verse 1]
Many years have gone
I’m waiting here for miracle
Trying hard not to fall
Building a life that is meaningful
I’m ready to fight
Fight till the end
Omo eleran o ma gbodo je egun (Son of a meat seller, they said I must be cursed)
I’m ready to stand
I’m never giving up

[Pre-Chorus]
Because Rome was not built in a day
Little drops of water make the ocean
Cause when I fall, I will stand up again
Again and again
I will make it one day

Because Rome was not built in a day
Little drops of water make the ocean
Cause when I fall, I will stand up again
Again and again
I will make it one day

[Chorus]
Ori (Head, in the context, head means destiny or fate)
B’ese mi soro (Talk to me)
Gbemi de bi ire (Carry me to my goodness)
Gbemi de bi ire (Carry me to my goodness)
Ori (Head, in the context, head means destiny or fate)
B’ese mi soro (Talk to me)
Gbemi de bi ire (Carry me to my goodness)
Gbemi de bi ire (Carry me to my goodness)

If na to fight, I go fight
If na to thief, I no go thief
I promise to make it on my own
K’ori mi ma ma gba abode (Anything to get back home)

If na to fight, I go fight
If na to steal, I no go steal
I promise to make it on my own
Struggling and hustling for my own

I’m ready to fight
Fight till the end
Omo alasho (Son of a dressmaker)
O ma gbodo wo akisa oo
I’m ready to stand, I’m never giving up

[Pre-Chorus]
Because Rome was not built in a day
Little drops of water make the ocean
Cause when I fall, I will stand up again
Again and again
I will make it one day

Because Rome was not built in a day
Little drops of water make the ocean
Cause when I fall, I will stand up again
Again and again
I will make it one day
Swaps….swaps

Blaqbonez one of the few that’s really rapping,
I’ll be handing out L’s to these rappers
They know I’m snapping,
You could take your L right off the bat
Like LL Cool J
Or somewhere in the middle
Like Samuel L Jackson yo
Getting all these accolades
Look at us, we’re the winning team
Niggas talk trash, don’t make us
Pull up with the magazines
Body bag them till the end of the world
I’ll probably ask John Boyega
To drop em’ off at the pacific rim
I’m snapping again
Starting a massive attack with the pen
I’m next to be king
Impartially ought to be sitting
But I’m waiting for M
It’s cool since the crown’s in the circle
No competition, where I’m chilling
It’s a mountain to get to
It’s like the corridors of power
In the building like that
You outside peeking, don’t make me
Come to the window with a mac
Battle rappers always tryna get at me
But they missing, like literally
When we talk about money they [hmmh]
Can’t really say that I’m surprised
Like for real man, I get it
The bigger the nigga
The more attention you get when you diss him
If you really wanna battle
Pay my booking fee nigga
Niggas tryna be like me
Should write a book for these niggas
Yeah, bars so dope
I’m getting high off my own supply I’m
Sniffing on my own shit
Stoned to death like I’m Goliath
Album of the year conversation
I really did it
Revenue hit a couple milli
How’d you think that I’m feeling bitch

[Verse 2 – Loose Kaynon]
Huhn, how is this still a conversation
If you want the confrontation then stop talking
I’m too busy to throw stones at every dog barking
I’m home alone in this Hip-Hop shit
Macaulay Culkin
Y’all on some follow the leader shit
Quit with this talking
It’s nothing, the crown is home
You bluffing so watch your tone
You’re humble in person
But online you’re Al-Capone
Leave me alone
Once I get in my zone
I spark a J and then say can ye (Kanye)
“watch the throne?”
Huh, was fucking broke for a while
So I ex’d her, success had a boyfriend
I got her number and text her
She call me ordinary
I said my first name was extra
Ambition schooled me to the art
But hunger was my lecturer, flow…
So special huh, nothing fresher
Cloth from a different cloth
See you, could check the texture
Hip-Hop was in a state or inertia
100 Crowns put under pressure
Check on your favourite rapper
Hope him well sha
We put the game on our backs
Cause the team strong
100 Crowns rap sicko heroes
These this the theme song
Y’all sneak dissing
When it comes to beef I like it raw
Your lungs ain’t big enough for
All the smoke that you’re asking for
Washed up rapper turn pop
Tryna son Hip-Hop artists
That’s not it chief
Shut the fuck up regardless
Nobody asked you
Your opinion is trash talk
We not not gon let that shit fly
Sit that plane on the Asphalt [groans]
I’m the head nigga in charge
The general and the serge
Y’all niggas is a mirage, verbal therapy
I give the beat a deep tissue massage
This is OG talk
Give your big hommie my regards [groans]
Taking shots? get it right when you aim
You into career suicide I’m not the one to blame
Pregnant with ideas of using me tryna get ahead in the game?
I’ll commit abortions, I’ll kill you before you get a name

[Verse 3 – AQ]
The next rapper needs no introduction
I’ve blossomed, three classic albums
I’m currently on my fourth one [laughs]
I make it hard for you to function
Y’all tried to blow up
I’ll blow shit out of proportion
This is God’s vision
I’m looking through perfect lenses
God body the God flow is in perfect tenses
God engineering, every time I let the pen speak
God’s in him, Godzilla, break your defences
Check the way I flip it, the bars apocalyptic
The fragment you imagine, imagination is vivid
My penmanship precision is wisdom and damn it is…
Making rappers madder than modern day feminists
Yo I’m, nemesis I’ve built businesses
And I can make you one
Natural resources my voice is vibranium
How you taking shots with a sub-par album
Those joints ain’t strong enough, you lack calcium
Go against me, there can only be two outcomes
You lose, you lose, like Buhari or Atiku
If that’s the premise on which you are voting
Then I don’t need to
You can let them deceive you
But hommie I ain’t with you
You do it for the gram, I do it for what I believe in
Make your girls mouth a nice place to place kids in
The dick with the medicine
I hit her with the penicillin
She stuck on me like bacteria, I’m back tearing her
Fans never miss the real, me I never miss a kill
Here today gone tomorrow bro you’re Mr. Real(the singer)
Pick a fight pick a struggle I can fit the bill
To keep it real your best rapper still stuck on stupid deals
And if you can take it I’m coming with slim cases
When the lamba hit, the shaku will switch places
Lines from my sleek pages be spitting your rib cages
Leaving you fugazi, I’m kinda like 2 Jay-Z’s
With a tide I rock nation I rock fellas I do ladies
Fuck the industry, I pay payola with suitcases
What you saying, who you playing
Who the fuck you fucking with?
All of y’all can suck a dick, I’m a legend like 2 Face is
May be not, I’m maybe close man
Fuck this shit man

[Verse 4 – M.I Abaga]
[Sighs] sometimes rapping isn’t fun at all
There’s nothing I can brag about, I done it all
There’s no (snow) rapper I can beef with man, I sun em all
And it’s real (Israel) praying to the sky hoping that manna fall
Shit, double entendre in the in the first four
What am I even on this verse for (four)?
Oh I get it, when you stick a knife inside a wound
That’s healing up, it hurts more
I see the stares at what we building
You can never find the first floor
Ou, the cypher the maddest the baddest
And brightest and I’m the head
Always the head, like niggas sucking vaginas
We arrive to help you pussies out
My niggas are Gynos(Gynaecologists)
How we do it isn’t fair, seems you guys are albinos ouu!
The boy terrific, and gifted and so prolific
Everything I push malicious it shifted the culture with it
Riveting imagery when M.I spit it
My music travel yes I move a pivot
Let me be more specific
I told you rappers fix up
Look at the way you niggas rapping now
SA rappers winning but guess what?
Naija is back in town
Call me NEPA dawg, all your life
I’ve been blacking out
Since 08 been on my captain Phillips
“I’m the captain now”
Four more bars, for my dawgs I got it
Loose and AQ we should make this episodic
Only open for rappers who deliver product
And yet that other Cognac, this is how to spend your budget
Fuck it!",M.I. Abaga x Blaqbonez x A-Q x Loose Kaynon (L.A.M.B)

Ain’t nobody badder than

Run am if u think u fit

I run the game yeah ain’t counterfeit

Aint gat no counterpart they can’t defeat

Its ironic they homophobic but still cant get the fuck off my dick

They want my spot, i swear they fantasized

And over analysize.. but when it comes to dope u know that am the guy

I sue the bro to court.. i rarely follow protocols

Its been a overhaul.. so imma leave this as unknown to y’all

But i ain’t y’all

And every time i’m looking to the sky, thanking God that i ain’t y’all

Gave y’all enough time to catch up… since i was A1

Daddy is home, let see which one of y’all is fit to play ball

Men have been at this, since man have been a boys

And money talks so when i speak am sure to use my invoice

So yea i really enjoy, leaving y’all niggas annoyed

So talk elbow, that’s the only time i transfer my joints

I go from start to fades, like its beginning to end

I turn two L’s to a W and now am winning again

I been a *gunna or gabbly* be the scene on a stage

Hip hop for naija na blur, feel like am rapping in vain

But i still kill it regardless

And you know me, am new school

But Henny put me up with 3 O’Gs

You must be drunk if u think u could belittle me now

I was the last born but right now i am the main child

Cos am between the past and future

The demons and Gods

Between the rappers and singer How i evened the odds

And that is something to consider like ain’t feeding your thoughts

And if we don’t get you in the street, we’ll just see you in court

Had some dawgs that wrote me off

Buh hallo this is me writing back

They say am top 5 and really i dont see no lie in that

And my pocket is been getting fat

Feeding all your fear, i see a killer bee and i attack

Men are here, nobody do it like you do

Before you talk bout my career please tell me what do you do

Oludemilade, i been seating on the throne

And you sound overrated well you just talking your own

Last bars imma make em count

Am making money and y’all murdafuckas don’t make em how

If y’all smile enough u see it on the bright side

Because when am going in y’all are saying for the outside…",Ycee

29,[Lyrics] Dremo – “Sigh”,"Ok, class in session..

Eyes red, i pass the highgrade like an examination…

Yaa we talk at occasion, but bruh…

Dont get it twisted there is a difference of we talking and having a conversation…

Just got back from Jamaica, my eyes make a bruh look Asian….

Bruh i gat no fucking chill, am always running out of patience…

Type of doctor to treat people, fuck up and run out of patients…

I’ma die fucking Great, i just up that they don’t find me naked…

Yea, i came in the game my mini me on the way..

Codename V2 On the way… Ah Ahnn

Around here we no dey pass the cake…

If u wan some u gats to bake… Ah Ahnn

Married to the game, this other rappers tryna to catch the bouquet… Ah Ahnn

Fuck around and i’ma beat the nigga up like Ke re ke ke din ke. ke re ke ke din ke…..

ke re ke ke din ke…

This fakes never reach, straight with me here that shits gonna make u gay…

Kerekeketike.. kerekeketike…

Like Thompson Klays Knee in game 6, dem no dey take me play…. (dem no dey take me play)…

Alright volume 2 suppose don arrive, but there is traffic as u can see..

Am trying to take another route and as a taxi driver, not really concerned about the tips…

But i gas to reach my destination before i end the trip…

Diamond Rocky like it’s ASAP..

Even when i smoke blunts i’ma still stay sharp…

Some of em say sing, some of em say rapp…

But i do what the fuck i want cos hey man..

Its codename Dremo are they mad…

I gat goons around me and they all stay strapped…

If u snap, if u snap, if u snap, if u snap

If u snap i’ma snap back like its face cap…

Talks too much? shut em up with a stapler…

As we land like acres.. we pulled up in 8cars..

And we gats fish these niggas up like say na geisha…

See am cooking up with no apron…

But she say am superman with no cape on…

Am gonna use my pen and get paper….

But the other pen, i put it on Nnkeka…

Ok now am done…

She say uhnn i gat a question but i think is really dumb…

I say what? She said never mind…

I say tell me what is wrong?

She say boy u really strong…

Tell me, if am right or wrong..

She say ..

How could you last longer than a Fela song?

But these Fellas don’t even last as long as a Dremo song…

Uhnnnnnnnn

She say what? I say nothing

She say tell me…

I say tell u what? I do this like is nothing

Gal I’m…

Never gonna treat my girls like senator Elisha Abbo…

But i beat the pussy up like am senator Elisha Abbo (Senator Elisha Abbo)

Saaaaaay whaaaaaat?

Never gonna treat my girls like senator Elisha Abbo

But i beat the pussy up like Senator Elisha Abbo.. Forget (Senator Elisha Abbo)

******Lyrics******

[Intro: Damian Marley]
Now greetings to the world
Voice of the one called Big Gong-Zilla alongside Burna Boy, ya know
Yes rude boy!

[Verse 1: Burna Boy]
Ya dun know we different
Different style we delivering
I don’t have no equivalent
Different predicament
Every day a different problem
Different life from the government
Different politics, people with different qualities
Different tings dem happening
Different feeling, looking for a different healing
Read it with a different meaning
Different book
Come with the different look
Same spliff, different toke
Different election, sell a different false hope
Then they make us with the different hope
It’s a different time, different tings pon de mind
Different steps we a climb
While dem connive
Different egos collide
Bag full of Different knife

[Verse 2: Damian Marley]
I hear no difference still be similar
Every man bleed blood, that’s a big similarity
Seven million show one cinema
What a world we live in
And through social media become the new encyclopedia
Exposing reality in a real time
Click a button, and watch a video
Then you might just find
Every man love dem family
That is another familiarity
To demonstrate the similarity
That doesn’t mean another big difference up in a quality
Ya cut from the real original

[Verse 3 : Burna Boy]
Ya dun know we different
Different acts of belligerence
But differently intelligent
Different medicine, mi na talk chemical medicine
Different leaves and remedies
Different studying of my roots and origin
Tell my truth in melodies
It’s the truth to the different lifestyle
Different from what me find out
You know say na mi use key and I got em a hide out
Fuck up the youth dem mind
Bringing a different force
To different gong we a boss
You know it ain’t hard to find us

44,Lyrics “Another Story” – Burna Boy ft. M.anifest,"Narrator: In 1900, Britain officially assumed responsibility for the administration of the whole of what we now know as Nigeria from the Niger Company
And then, gradually over the years, British protectorates were established throughout the territory
In 1914, the protectorates were amalgamated into one Nigeria

Actually, there’s one additional detail that bears mentioning
In order to take over the territories from the Niger Company, the British Government paid 865,000 pounds
A huge amount in 1900
So let’s establish a simple truth, the British didn’t travel halfway across the world just to spread democracy
Nigeria started off as a business deal for them, between a company and a government
Incidentally, the Niger Company is still around today
Only it is known by a different name, Unilever
But that’s another story

It’s Kel-P vibes

She said she really grew up poor like me
Don’t believe in nothin’ but the almighty
Just a likkle jeans and a pure white tee
She never did forever be nobody wifey, yeah
So while I may not pretty boy, your heart is amiss
Play it like a villain ’cause she caught in a wave
Tonight iii I am walkin’ away
Lined up my mind, on the grind, yeah, yeah

[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid]
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin’ on how you hold me
I’m glad that I’m calmin’ down, can’t let no one come control me
Keep dancin’ and call it love, she fightin’ but fallin’ slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me

[Chorus: Wizkid]
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say

[Verse 2: Beyoncé]
Pose like a trophy when Naomi’s walk in
She need an Oscar for that pretty dark skin
Pretty like Lupita when the cameras close in
Drip broke the levee when my Kelly’s roll in
I think tonight she might braid her braids
Melanin too dark to throw her shade
She minds her business and winds her waist
Gold like 24k, okay

[Pre-Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Tonight I might fall in love, dependin’ on how you hold me
I’m glad that I’m calmin’ down, can’t let no one come control me
Keep dancin’ and call it love, she fightin’ but fallin’ slowly
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told me

[Chorus: Wizkid & Beyoncé]
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
Your back against the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say
Brown skin girl, ya skin just like pearls
The best thing in all the world
I never trade you for anybody else, say

[Verse 3: Beyoncé]
Oh, have you looked in the mirror lately? (Lately)
Wish you could trade eyes with me (Because)
There’s complexities in complexion
But your skin, it glow like diamonds
Dig me like the earth, you be giving birth
Took everything in life, baby, know your worth
I love everything about you, from your nappy curls
To every single curve, your body natural
Same skin that was broken, be the same skin takin’ over
Most things out of focus, view
But when you’re in the room, they notice you (Notice you)
‘Cause you’re beautiful
Yeah, you’re beautiful

[Pre-Chorus: Beyoncé]
Them men, them gon’ fall in love, with you and all of your glory
Your skin is not only dark, it shines and it tells your story
Keep dancin’, they can’t control you
They watchin’, they all adore you
If ever you are in doubt, remember what mama told you

[Chorus: Beyoncé & Wizkid]
Brown skin girl (Brown skin girl), ya skin just like pearls (Brown skin girl)
Your back against the world (Oh)
I never trade you for anybody else, say (No, no)
Brown skin girl (Brown skin girl), ya skin just like pearls (Brown skin)

I never trade you for anybody else, say

Sleek Is Amazing

[Oladips]
Ah Omo iya aje

Ahn ahn

Oluwa lo pa wa mo lati January wo December

Nigba ti a ri owo se fire oloboro, ti ko si eba

Nigba ti ko si record label, helper tabi sponsor

When i was doing it for passion and the culture

All my life i have been on a mission to be great

I sacrificed everything bro, whatever that it takes

And maybe i was selfish at some point in my life,

Cus while making choices i could have made some mistakes

Well, if you ask, i would say it’s true

I mean, Maybe i should have stayed in school

Maybe i should have been in church or prayed with you,

But music chose me, so i thought its cool

Cus i thought its you like this talent is God’s gift, right?

Unless of course it is all drift

What if this is just God testing my faith and all this are just trips

A Doctors will never joke around when it’s real cancer

Metaphorically speaking, God i need answers

Cus every step that i took and every move that i made was a leap of faith that i took in your name

I hate to accept that i failed

Already lost count of the times that i prayed

Give me a sign, i need to be sure that you are listening

Aijebe baba God, emi ati yin oni jo ni isinmi

Huh, maybe i shouldn’t blame you

I mean i met Reminisce and it was through the same you

I had a plan and i thought that we would finish work

I want to know why, God tell me why it didn’t work

I was a young promising dips before i signed to label

Same reason why i had to leave the label

I used to be responsible for my loss and wins

Then it felt like someone cut my wings

Dam! Maybe i shouldn’t have signed in the first place

Now i feel like choking myself with my necklace

The day that i signed, i wish there was an eclipse

I would have stayed in my house and watched my Netflix

No regrets tho! Just life lessons

And ever since i left, i’ve been in my right senses

You need to be in my shoes to know how it really feels

No more taking drugs and no more popping bills

I know you did all you could but…

We don’t do the things that we should

I thought we had a business but you told me you was helping me

But why did you give me a fucking deal if you was helping me

Your mindset is a riddle that i solved

And… here is the reason that i brawled

If you spend a dollar and you claimed that is a favour

Then the contract was a f-cking trap and a fraud

There are two sides to a story

I had to pour my mind out tho, i’m sorry

You never saw me making money for the label, everything you did, feels like you did it for the optics

Maybe along the line i had my own flaws

Maybe i am just lost in my own thought

Let me pause for a minute and be my own judge

Maybe its not your fault, maybe its my own probs

Dear upcomings, i know you wish to be signed

I know you want the celebrity life so you choose to be blind

But let this be a lesson and a boost to your brand

Take advantage of the internet, get used to your brand

Get used to the hustle cause it’s deeper that you think

Because life is also hard for most of the niggas that you see

Take it easy on yourself bro, it’s better to grow slowly

Don’t be like me and some of my colleagues with same story

Wo! I’m responsible for my actions

Omo alakisa mi shi ma pada di alaso

Sugbon ti ko ba ni idi mi o le ma para with no reason

But Iya bode so fun mi pe ain’t nobody owe me shit

Ain.t nobody owe me shit, right? but i signed a deal then i expected some doings

Regardless, thank you for everything!

Ah ah, ori Iya Bode oh ma je ko ri mi gbabode oh

Lati Monday to Saturday oh

Je ki aye ye mi

Ori iya Bode oh ma je ko ri mi gbabode oh

Ah!

If to say I be fine girl
It’s Tension Gang baby

[Verse 1 – Magnito]
Ok! Let’s go
If to say I be girl eh
My guy go dey do G
And my song selection go be little bit of Jazz and a little bit of fuji
I go dey speak fonee
I go dey act like say the girl bad and she boujee
If I ever wanna eat, I’ll eat only steak and I’ll follow up with sushi
If to say I be girl eh
Man must open doors for me
E go open club for me, better one for that matter
Then again open store for me
He be cooking from morning to evening
Doing the dishes, e go even mop for me
He will do only what I ask for
E go be like say Juju dey work for me

[Chorus]
My life is all about car money money and wara wara mula
Money money and wara wara mula
Money money and wara wara mula
It’s the money money and wara wara mula

[Verse 2 – Falz]
If to say I be Girl Ehn
I go dey bear Sister Maria
I no go fornicate
I no go follow man
Only do God and my career
Any body wey no help my spiritual life
I cut off like sharia (Get out of here)
And I go keep my cherry intact till I marry
Na my husband go pioneer
Na Lie
That’s Stereotype
Why I no fit be Oga
Why I no fit marry Mr billionaire
Why your papa wan dey tell me what to do
Not to talk of the cloth that I can wear (I am asking)
If to say I be girl eh
I no go even yell eh (I can’t shout)
I go dey live my life how I want
Make them say I no make wife material (I don’t care)
I no go let any bad guy come tell me what to do with my vagina
I be big girl I be Auntina, Ahn ahn

[Chorus]
My life is all about car money money and wara wara mula
Money money and wara wara mula
Money money and wara wara mula

If I waka pass Ibadan na everybody go dey gather

Dem don dey clap, dem don dey hail
Before you know, you don carry belle
If to say I be girl eh

I no go enter any Acura
My life is just all about the chada chada wara wara mula
Money money and wara wara mula

49,[Lyrics] Asa – The Beginning,"I didn’t see it coming
Won’t believe If someone else told me

I’ve been waiting for years
I’ve been waiting for years

Even though we near
Like we far away
Far from far away
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Let’s go back to the beginning

None of us must have a last say
I’m writing you this letter
Hoping we can make things clearer
Over all the shouting
We forget to hear each other

And I missed for days
In so many ways

Even though we near
Like we far away
Far from far away
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Can you hear me
Let’s go back to the beginning",Asa
